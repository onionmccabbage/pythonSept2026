## Python Review 2: the Star Wars API (Swapi)
#### 1hour 10min (2:55)

Ask the user for a category (and also for an id)
Use these to make a call to an API and show the results

This is a chance to explore Python 
- Alter these instructions to suit your thinking
- Think about architecture (maybe use separate functions, modules and imports)
  (although it can be one single file if you like!!)
- Look online, talk to each other, ask me etc.
There will be an opportunity to share your code at the end

#### Details:

Write a new module which asks the user for a 'category' 
(remember to use input() which always returns a string)
Validate the user input as follows:
- The category may only be one of 'people', 'planets', 'starships' or 'species'
  (maybe use the 'in' operator to see if the value is in a tuple of permitted values)

Also ask the user to enter an id
- The id must be a positive integer in the range 1-8
After you ask the user for category value, build a string something like this: 
  url = f'https://swapi.dev/api/{cat}/{id}'
  (here we inject the 'category' and 'id' into the curly brackets)

Use the 'requests' library to make a 'get' call to this API
Show the user what was returned by printing a nicely formatted string

Remember to handle potential exceptions

#### Optional

We need to ensure the two parameters are in the required form:
Write a module containing a function called 'cleanup' which receives arguments
The cleanup function should ensure:
- there is a value for the 'category' and it is a non-empty string 
  containing one of the permitted categories
- there is a value for the 'id' and it is a positive integer within range
If category or id is missing or unacceptable, you should provide sensible defaults
For example, if id is a floating point number or a string, try to cast it as an int()
Import and use your 'cleanup' function to sanitize the user-provided data
